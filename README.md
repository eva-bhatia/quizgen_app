Heyyy! This is my AWESOME quiz app I made! It lets you make quizzes about ANYTHING! You can even upload PDF files and it will make quizzes from them! How cool is that?!?! ðŸ˜Ž

## What This App Can Do (It's SO COOL!)

- Make quizzes about ANY topic you want!
- Upload PDFs and make quizzes from them (like for homework and stuff)
- Pick how hard you want the questions to be
- Answer questions and see if you're right or wrong RIGHT AWAY!
- See your scores at the end!
- Save your quizzes for later!

## How To Run This On Your Computer

OK so to run this app on your computer, follow these steps (it's not that hard I promise!):

### 1. Clone the Repository (that means download the code)

```bash
Download all the files
OR
git clone https://github.com/eva-bhatia/quizgen_app.git
cd quizgen_app
```

### 2. Install All The Stuff You Need

```bash
npm install
```
(This might take FOREVER but just wait lol)

### 3. Set Up Your Secret API Key

You need to make a file called `.env` in the main folder. Put this in it:

```
# OpenAI API Key - YOU NEED TO GET YOUR OWN KEY!
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

You need to get an API key from OpenAI's website: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys


```

### 5. Start The App!!!

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5001

AND BOOM! ðŸ’¥ You're in!

## Problems? Here's Some Help!

- If you see an error about the OpenAI API key, make sure you added your real key in the `.env` file!
